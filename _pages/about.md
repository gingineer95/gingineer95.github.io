I have recently completed my Master of Science in Robotics at Northwestern University (2020-2021 Cohort). Some of the topics I've learned in class include robotic manipulation, navigation, mechatronics, SLAM and computer vision. You can see how I've applied these topics in various projects <a href="https://gingineer95.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.

I recieved my Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering from the Milwaukee School of Engineering in 2017. At MSOE, I worked on a senior design project centered around the NASA Lunabotics competition. I lead the excavation sub-system where, using MATLAB, I simulated various mathetmaical models to determine the digging forces applied on conveyorized buckets. Once I found an optimal design, I 3D printed the buckets, fabricated the conveyor system and confirmed functionality via testing. 

From May 2017 to August 2020 I worked as a Project Engineer at Spraying Systems Co., an industrial company that makes spray nozzles. There I worked as the leader of a 3-person group in charge of developing robotic spraying. Using a 6-axis FANUC robotic arm we attached various nozzles as the end of arm tooling. With nozzle mobility we were able to create more elborate spray patterns and greatly reduce liquid waste. You can read more about my work with the FANUC arm <a href="https://gingineer95.github.io/2020/08/28/FANUC/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.

When I'm not working on my robotics projects, you can usually find me at my local pottery studio where I've enjoyed making a multitude of mugs, plates and bowls!
